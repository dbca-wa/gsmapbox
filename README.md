# gsmapbox
Mapbox client meant to browse/download content from geoserver rest api

## Usage
Download as a zip and extract to `$GEOSERVER_DATA_DIR/www/gsmapbox` or similar location, then access by browsing to https://mygeoserverurl/geoserver/www/gsmapbox/index.html and use to query/preview/download WFS resources.

Currently using a restricted mapbox token, this will only work on whitelisted domains, switch with your own for other usage.
